[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:44 (find_package):
  By not providing "Finddeque.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "deque", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "deque" with any of
  the following names:

    dequeConfig.cmake
    deque-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "deque" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "deque_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "deque"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
